Note to other developers.
- It is not possible to provide reproducible builds as APH needs to be signed with the same key ACR Phone is signed with.
- APH put together in around a week.
- Do not expect trendy architectural implementations.
- Never mind the spelling mistakes.
- Might accept pull requests.
